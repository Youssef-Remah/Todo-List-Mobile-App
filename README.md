# Todo List Mobile App

Welcome to the Todo List Mobile App repository! This is a simple React Native mobile app that allows users to manage their tasks effectively.
With an intuitive user interface, you can **add** tasks, mark them as **completed**, and **delete** them as needed.

## Features

- **Add tasks:** Use the input field at the top of the screen to enter your task name, then press the "Add" button to add it to your task list.
- **Task List:** All your tasks will be displayed in a scrollable list below the input field. You can easily scroll through your tasks.
- **Task Completion:** Each task in the list will have a checkbox next to it. You can mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox.
- **Task Deletion:** To remove a task, you can mark the "Delete" checkbox associated with each task. Once marked, the selected task will be removed from your task list.
- **Tasks Summary:** A title above the task list will show you how many tasks are done from your task list, helping you keep track of your progress.
